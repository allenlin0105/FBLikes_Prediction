# Facebook Likes Prediction

## Goal
- I crawl data from a certain facebook page. Based on each post, I try to predict the possible likes on it, such as "like", "laugh", and "angry", using deep learning. 
- With this model, it can be used on analysing user reaction and predicting future posts' reaction.
